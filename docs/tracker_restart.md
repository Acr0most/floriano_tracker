## tracker restart

Restarts the last stopped time tracking.

### Synopsis


Restarts the last stopped time tracking.

  Example:

  $ tracker start someproject +sometag
  // ... wait
  $ tracker stop
  // ... wait
  $ tracker restart

  In this case tracker restart will now start a new time tracking with project "someproject" and tags "sometag".
  i.e. tracker restart will repeat the last not cancelled tracker start command.

```
tracker restart
```
